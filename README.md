# Tensorflow - 1.13.1
TensorFlow 2.0 is out but as a matter of reliability I am going with Tensorflow 1.  
Also Tensorflow 1 has lots of community solved solutions already available & anyways its just a matter of API changes & upgrade from Sesssion to Eager Executiion. Once done with Tensorflow we wont find it difficult to adapt to Tensorflow 2.0+.

Pro Tip: Also any one willing to open this notebook in Google Colab can install "Open Notebook in Colab" Plugin. It comes handy at times.

This repository contains TensorFlow *Low-Level + High-Level API* implementations.  
Plan of attack:
*Tensorflow*    
*PyTorch*   
*Optimizing Tensorflow & PyTorch models*  
*TensorRT(7.1.3) for faster inferencing on deployment*
